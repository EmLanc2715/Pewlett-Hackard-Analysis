# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
pgAdmin4 Postgres SQL

## Overview

Pewlett-Hackard is a large company with several thousand employees. Pewlett-Hackard is preparing for the "silver tsunami", where a substantial amount of their work force will be retiring. I worked with Bobby, a P-H HR analyst, to help determine who will be retiring in the next few years and how many positions will need to be filled. Bobby and I used SQL to build an employee database to show who is eligible for retirement and what role will need to be filled once someone retires.

### Purpose 

Specifically, Bobby and I determined the number of retiring employees per title, and identified employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program to fill these roles.

## Results

1.Pewlett-Hackard has a total of 240,124 current employees. Their database contains information on 300,024 employees, which includes employees no longer working at the company.

2. The retirement_count table shows that across all 9 departments, there are a total of 36,619 employees at retirement age currently.

However, in the next three years, the number of employees eligible for retirement jumps up to 133,776.

## Summary

1. How many roles will need filled as Pewlett-Hackard experiences the "silver tsunami"?
  - 133,776 employees will be meeting the requirements to retire in the next 3 years. There are only 240,140 current employees at the company, and this points to a         disaster if P-H does not start hiring and promoting employees to mitigate the impact of the "silver tsunami". 

2. Are there enough qualified employees in all of the departments to be mentored into senior job titles?
  - Currently, no, there are only 1549 employees eligible for mentorship.
