# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
pgAdmin4 Postgres SQL

## Overview

Pewlett-Hackard is a large company with several thousand employees. Pewlett-Hackard is preparing for the "silver tsunami", where a substantial amount of their work force will be retiring. I worked with Bobby, a P-H HR analyst, to help determine who will be retiring in the next few years and how many positions will need to be filled. Bobby and I used SQL to build an employee database to show who is eligible for retirement and what role will need to be filled once someone retires.

### Purpose 

Specifically, Bobby and I determined the number of retiring employees per title, and identified employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program to fill these roles.

## Results

1.
2. The retirement_count table shows that across all 9 departments, there are a total of 36,619 employees at retirement age.
